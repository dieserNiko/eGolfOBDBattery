Script for reading battery percentage and charging power from OBD and displaying it on a small screen and a Raspberry Pi Zero.

The script itself shoud be more or less self explaining, even more so with all of my comments in it. Feel free to try it out or use it as inspiration for your own projects. Sometimes I had to place the definitions for methods inside loops and other operators, I can't explain why but it was the only way I got it to work. Maybe there are better ways to do this but I'm no expert in python and just happy to get it to work at all.

If there are any more questions feel free to contact me on Twitter or here or just expand the script yourself :) I'm also still open for more ideas!
